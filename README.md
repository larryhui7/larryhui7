## Hey! Iâ€™m Larry, welcome to my page!  ðŸ‘‹

I am pursuing my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and EECS at UC Berkeley.
- My interests span multiple areas, namely at the intersection of Mechanics for Design, FEA/CFD, and materials with robotics, controls, optimization, and machine learning.
- For engineering implementation (Controls, Image Processing, Statistics, CVX, FEMLAB, etc.) I often use `.m`, `.slx`, and `.py` but am versed in `.java`, `.tex`, and `.cpp`

To see what I'm up to (or previous projects) you should look at the following or email me:
