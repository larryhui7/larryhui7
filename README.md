## Hey! I’m Larry, welcome to my page!  👋

I am pursuing my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and (hopefully) EECS at UC Berkeley.
- 🤖 My interests span multiple areas, namely at the intersection of Mechanics for Design, FEA/CFD, and materials with robotics, controls, optimization, and machine learning.
- Currently, my coursework includes:
  - **[COMPSCI 189/287A: Introduction to Machine Learning](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/CS189/)** taught by Professor [Jonathan R. Shewchuck](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/)
  - **[MEC ENG 100: Electronics for the Internet of Things](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2025-spring-meceng-100-001-lec-001)** taught by [Dr. George Anwar](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/george-anwar/)
  - **[MEC ENG 104: Engineering Mechanics II](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2025-spring-meceng-104-001-lec-001)** taught by Professor [David J. Steigmann](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/david-steigmann/)
  - **[MEC ENG C180: Engineering Analysis using the Finite Element Method](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2025-spring-meceng-c180-001-lec-001)** taught by Professor [Tarek I. Zohdi](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/tarek-i-zohdi/)

- 👨‍💻 For engineering implementation (Controls, Image Processing, Statistics, CVX, FEMLAB, etc.) I often use `.m`, `.slx`, and `.py` but am versed in `.java`, `.tex`, and `.cpp`
